# Project Overview

This project applies cohort analysis to evaluate customer retention patterns in the e-commerce industry. Instead of analyzing all customers as a single group, the study segments users into monthly acquisition cohorts based on their first purchase date and tracks their behavior over time.

The goal is to understand:

How long customers remain active

How retention changes across different cohorts

The impact of time, seasonality, and marketing on customer loyalty

Which cohorts are most valuable to the business

By using a structured, data-driven approach, this project provides actionable insights that can help businesses improve customer engagement, reduce churn, and optimize marketing strategies.

# Objectives

This project aims to:

Segment customers into cohorts based on their first purchase month

Track customer retention over time using cohort aging

Compute retention rates across multiple time periods

Visualize retention trends using heatmaps and line charts

Provide insights that can guide business decisions such as:

Targeted marketing

Loyalty programs

Personalized recommendations

Customer lifetime value strategies

# Dataset

The analysis uses transactional e-commerce customer data containing:

CustomerID – Unique identifier for each customer

InvoiceDate – Date of purchase

InvoiceNo – Transaction ID

Quantity – Number of items purchased

UnitPrice – Price per item

📌 You can replace this with your own dataset following a similar structure.

#  Tools & Technologies

This project is implemented using:

Python

Pandas – Data cleaning and manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis

# Methodology
Step 1: Data Cleaning

Remove missing values

Standardize date formats

Filter invalid transactions

Step 2: Define Customer Cohorts

Identify each customer’s first purchase month

Assign them to a cohort labeled by that month

Step 3: Calculate Cohort Age

Compute how many months have passed since the customer’s first purchase

Step 4: Compute Retention Rates

Create a cohort retention matrix

Measure the percentage of customers who return in each subsequent month

Step 5: Visualization

Generate heatmaps to display retention patterns

Plot trend lines to compare cohorts

 # Key Insights (Example Findings)

From this analysis, businesses can:

Identify which acquisition months produce the most loyal customers

Detect seasonal retention patterns

Evaluate the effectiveness of past marketing campaigns

Identify when customers are most likely to churn

Improve onboarding strategies for new users
